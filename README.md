# WMR

> [!WARNING]
> WMR is unfortunately no longer maintained. In its place, we'd recommend [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) with [`@preactjs/preset-vite`](https://github.com/preactjs/preset-vite). It offers many of the same features (like the prerendering API) but is much more robust and up to date. Thanks to all contributors and users over the years!

**The tiny all-in-one development tool for modern web apps**, in a single 2mb file with no dependencies.

All the features you'd expect and more, from development to production:

üî® &nbsp; No entry points or pages to configure - just HTML files with `<script type=module>`<br>
ü¶¶ &nbsp; Safely `import "packages"` from npm **_without installation_**<br>
üì¶ &nbsp; Smart bundling and caching for npm dependencies<br>
‚Üª &nbsp; Hot reloading for modules, Preact components and CSS<br>
‚ö°Ô∏è &nbsp; Lightning-fast JSX support that you can debug in the browser<br>
üíÑ &nbsp; Import CSS files and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) (`*.module.css`)<br>
üî© &nbsp; Out-of-the-box support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)<br>
üìÇ &nbsp; Static file serving with hot reloading of CSS and images<br>
üóú &nbsp; Highly optimized Rollup-based production output (`wmr build`)<br>
üìë &nbsp; Crawls and pre-renders your app's pages to static HTML at build time<br>
üèé &nbsp; Built-in HTTP2 in dev and prod (`wmr serve --http2`)<br>
üîß &nbsp; Supports [Rollup plugins](packages/wmr/README.md#configuration-and-plugins), even in development where Rollup isn't used

## Quickstart _(recommended)_

Create a new project in seconds using [create-wmr](https://npm.im/create-wmr):

<strong><code>npm init wmr your-project-name</code></strong>

or

<strong><code>yarn create wmr your-project-name</code></strong>

> üíÅ If you'd like ESLint to be set up for you, add `--eslint` to the command. _Note: this will use 150mb of disk space._

## Contributing

```sh
git clone git@github.com:preactjs/wmr.git
cd wmr
yarn

# run the demo (no compile)
yarn demo serve

# build and serve the demo for prod
yarn demo build:prod && yarn demo serve:prod

# build the single-file CLI:
yarn workspace wmr build
```

### Adding a changeset

Don't forget to also include a changeset, by running this command at the root of the project:

```sh
yarn changeset
```

This will take you through a process of selecting the changed packages, the version updates and a description of the change. Afterwards, `changesets`, will generate a `.md` file inside a `.changeset` directory. Please commit that file as well.

After all that, you are good to go. :+1:
