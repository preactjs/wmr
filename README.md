**The tiny all-in-one development tool for modern web apps**, in a single 2mb file with no dependencies.

All the features you'd expect and more, from development to production:

🔨 &nbsp; No entry points or pages to configure - just HTML files with `<script type=module>`<br>
🦦 &nbsp; Safely `import "packages"` from npm **_without installation_**<br>
📦 &nbsp; Smart bundling and caching for npm dependencies<br>
↻ &nbsp; Hot reloading for modules, Preact components and CSS<br>
⚡️ &nbsp; Lightning-fast JSX support that you can debug in the browser<br>
💄 &nbsp; Import CSS files and [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) (`*.module.css`)<br>
🔩 &nbsp; Out-of-the-box support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)<br>
📂 &nbsp; Static file serving with hot reloading of CSS and images<br>
🗜 &nbsp; Highly optimized Rollup-based production output (`wmr build`)<br>
📑 &nbsp; Crawls and pre-renders your app's pages to static HTML at build time<br>
🏎 &nbsp; Built-in HTTP2 in dev and prod (`wmr serve --http2`)<br>
🔧 &nbsp; Supports [Rollup plugins](packages/wmr/README.md#configuration-and-plugins), even in development where Rollup isn't used

## Quickstart _(recommended)_

Create a new project in seconds using [create-wmr](https://npm.im/create-wmr):

<strong><code>npm init wmr your-project-name</code></strong>

or

<strong><code>yarn create wmr your-project-name</code></strong>

> 💁 If you'd like ESLint to be set up for you, add `--eslint` to the command. _Note: this will use 150mb of disk space._

### Adding a changeset

Don't forget to also include a changeset, by runing this command at the root of the project:

```sh
yarn changeset
```

This will take you through a process of selecting the changed packages, the version updates and a description of the change. Aferwards, `changesets`, will generate a `.md` file inside a `.changeset` directory. Please commit that file as well.

After all that, you are good to go. :+1
